#  ABOUT ME

I am Siddharth Dudugu, a dedicated data science professional with a profound passion for data-driven solutions and insights. With a rich tapestry of experiences across various roles, I have honed my skills in Python, data engineering, business intelligence, data analysis, machine learning, and project management. My journey in data science is marked by a commitment to leveraging technology to solve complex problems and drive impactful results.

My academic background includes a Master’s degree in Data Science from Drexel University, where I achieved a GPA of 3.9/4.0. I also hold a Graduate Diploma in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning from the National Institute of Technology Warangal, and a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from the University of Mumbai.

As an undergraduate, I was actively involved in the Machine Learning Club, Artificial Intelligence Club, IEEE, and the AI & ML Club. As a graduate student at Drexel University, I also served as a Course Assistant - supporting data acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, and interpretation courses. Additionally, at Drexel University, I worked as an Intramural Official & Program Assistant, where I developed skills in team leadership, organization, public speaking, and interpersonal communication while coordinating intramural sports programs.

Currently, I serve as a Data Research Analyst at Map Collective Inc., where I use advanced tools and techniques such as Python, data visualization, and mapping techniques to improve emissions tracking by 25% and supplier management efficiency by 20%. I contributed to a 15% reduction in the company’s carbon footprint.

As a Data Analyst Intern at Data Glacier, I used Python, Power BI, machine learning algorithms, and ELT pipelines to provide insights, streamline workflows, and reduce data duplicates by 50%.

At Innobrand Media & Cmmunicaions, I enhanced television and digital media ratings by 15% through strategic content analysis and targeted scheduling, leveraging SQL and Excel. Increased TV and digital ad ROI by 20% through market research and optimized time slot allocation using Python. And, conducted impactful EDA with Power BI, improving advertising effectiveness by 40%. Furthermore, implemented ML for market segmentation, resulting in a 12% revenue increase and 35% data error reduction.

In addition to my professional and academic pursuits, I have contributed to the field through my publication "A Survey on Text Mining" in IEEE. I volunteer with the Dharma Bharati Mission and as a facilitator at AIESEC, conducting events to raise awareness of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals. As an Operations Executive at AIESEC, I utilized SQL and Tableau for data analysis, created dashboards, and conducted A/B testing. I have received honors such as the Doris Zimmerman Endowed Scholarship and the Hamilton Scholarship from Drexel University.
